    <h2 class="subheadings"> Technical Studies  </h2>
		<p class ="paragraphs1">  Tech Studies has provided a wonderful practical grounding and has played a part in 
					most of the ways I've been trying to work this year. I've also learned loads about putting things online. I knew nothing about opensource, code,
				languages (HTML/CSS/Javascript) and now know enough to have built this website! I enjoy how
				everything is so entangled, and the website gives me a platform to collate all of my work and practices
				in one place. I did have to outsource some help (in the form of Hacksmiths) in order to get the website
				working, but the module allowed me to see the potential of web. The explorations from the web 
				workshop can be viewed  <a href = "http://wemmily.com/Portfolio/web.html">here.</a> I gained
				a lot of appreciation for how taking something further by yourself can be so beneficial. In the
				past I've gone to Risograph printing workshops and bookbinding workshops in order to further my
				understanding of print and paper arts- and I'm so grateful for a grounding in something digital. 
				I'd like to find something like this that is web-related and maybe this manifests in a short course 
				somewhere or teaming up with a Hacksmiths team member on one of my projects in the future. 
				Building the website is just the first step...</p>

				(recycling symbol) and therefore what kind of plastic is.  I particularly enjoyed working with 
				HDPE (High Density Polyethylene). I acquired six milk bottles, chopped them up, and melted them 
				into a lovely HDPE slab with green and blue flecks in it from the milk bottle lids. 
				I plan to save this piece of plastic for the future, when I find something that I would
