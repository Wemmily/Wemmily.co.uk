		 <h2 class="subheadings"> Technical Studies  </h2>
		<p class ="paragraphs1">  Tech Studies has provided a wonderful practical grounding and has played a part in 
					most of the ways I've been trying to work this year. I've also learned loads about putting things online. I knew nothing about opensource, code,
				languages (HTML/CSS/Javascript) and now know enough to have built this website! I enjoy how
				everything is so entangled, and the website gives me a platform to collate all of my work and practices
				in one place. I did have to outsource some help (in the form of Hacksmiths) in order to get the website
				working, but the module allowed me to see the potential of web. The explorations from the web 
				workshop can be viewed  <a href = "http://wemmily.com/Portfolio/web.html">here.</a> I gained
				a lot of appreciation for how taking something further by yourself can be so beneficial. In the
				past I've gone to Risograph printing workshops and bookbinding workshops in order to further my
				understanding of print and paper arts- and I'm so grateful for a grounding in something digital. 
				I'd like to find something like this that is web-related and maybe this manifests in a short course 
				somewhere or teaming up with a Hacksmiths team member on one of my projects in the future. 
				Building the website is just the first step...</p>

				 <h2 class="subheadings"> Methods and Processes (Working Document) 08/01/18-Present </h1>
   	<p class ="paragraphs1"> Methods and Processes is a Module on the Design Course that allows us to build skills
				in order to be better Studio Practitioners, and ultimately aid us in our production of work.
				We did workshops on model making/thinking through cardboard, ideation, research and one called
				'speculate, substantiate' which I enjoyed the most (I think), but am yet to decipher the 
				intentions of. There are still four more workshops to complete in the series of eight.</p>
   	<p class ="paragraphs1"> Thinking through Cardboard/Model making was fun, because it allowed us to generate 3D outcomes
				and test our ideas relatively quickly. I found value in the cardboard models being something that
				could be easily re-sculpted, meaning I wasn't too precious about them, and could generate ideas 
				more freely. I suppose the real skill in this is learning to use this re-moldable quality of the cardboard
				up to a certain point in order to let creativity flow, but once nearing a final outcome, the models
				need to be more precise, intricate and neat. Knowing when this point is, however, might be challenging
				to find, but I am sure now I am aware of it that it will come with time and be easier to accomplish.</p>
   	<p class ="paragraphs1"> Ideation was a difficult day, it involved what seemed like a lot of tedious thinking. I think this
				is probably a standard feeling the first time a workshop like this evolves and reveals itself, becuase
				as a student, you aren't quite sure what is supposed to be happening, or where you are supposed to 
				end up. The main idea, however, was that the tutor (Stuart) did not know anything about the list of 
				topics he brought into the room, and together (50 Students +1 Tutor) would unpick the subject matter
				long enough to have some 'interesting ideas'. Although we were warned that they would not necessarily
				be 'good ideas', it was implied that if we worked hard enough that the ideas would at least be 'interesting'.</p>
	<p class ="paragraphs1"> After a process of elimination, the topic of "Social TV" was chosen. It was here that the power of
				words and naming things in interesting ways revealed itself to me. If the topic had just been "Social"
				then I think we would have struggled to find something to talk about, but by pairing it with the word
				"TV" we were forced to think about the Social related interactions that involve TV, and the TV related
				interactions that involve Social. An avenue of exploration opened up, wide enough that we would have 
				something to talk about, but narrow enough that we could dig relatively deep within the given constraints, 
				and eventually find something meaningful and worthwhile. (This said, I remember the process, but none of 
				the outcomes. This is good, because I now know a good process for Ideation, and can apply it to other 
				scenarios and subject matter).</p>
	<p class ="paragraphs1"> Research day felt very tedious again. We were asked to research a given building down the Old Kent Road.
				Some people had Chicken Shops, Barbers, Tattoo Parlours, Pubs and Book Shops. We had Deptford Town Hall.
				This proved a useful task in delegating different research tasks to different people. In dividing up the
				smaller tasks we wanted to accomplish, we were able to conquer the task as a whole. We were encouraged to
				find 'alternative' or 'creative' ways to research the buildings, and document this research, too. I decided
				to go and draw the town hall, and make some rubbings of its more interesting architectural features. Some of 
				the better presentations came from the people who had taken more 'abstract' approaches, and formed unusual 
				ways of undertaking and presenting their research. This aligns with the 'Design and Meaning' Lecture series, 
				whereby it is good to be the 'purple cow'. What Sean Hall forgets to mention with this is that if everyone
				decides to be the '*PURPLE* cow', we will just be a room of purple cows. However, if everyone takes on an 
				unusual form, as well as an unusual colour, we will end up with a "Rainbow Zoo" of Designers and Creators
				and collectively, in being as different from eachother as possible, will manage to be a very interesting group
				of Research Gatherers and Idea Generators. </p>
	<p class ="paragraphs1"> "Speculate, Substantiate" involved forming theories without solid facts, and then providing evidence to prove/support
				or make truth of the theories, or at least make them semi-believable/realistic. I felt somewhat limited by the nature
				of the booklet we were given to carry out the process, but perhaps this was the point. I am used to the large A3 pages
				of my sketchbook, and not feeling restricted by space or the staple in the corner of the page. I also think that
				this would be a very useful tool for authors or illustrators, as it seemed very geared towards story telling. Initially
				it did not feel like it was geared towards Designers. It did, however, begin to slot into place when Sean Hall was talking
				to us about story telling, and how it is a valuable tool in designing. I'll have to look over my notes to substantiate this 
				interpretation. I felt very silly phoning up companies in the Yellow Pages in order to answer questions about
				my work and the task. I did not feel like phoning them was justified, as the inconvenience it caused them was greater than
				the benefit of the tiny piece of information I would have been obtaining. I think I will use this method in the future, but
				only secondary to emails, letter writing, and in-person visits and conversations. And more importantly, only if the piece of
				information I want to obtain is specific and valuable enough to warrant interrupting someone's work day. I feel like as a Designer,
				you have to be very careful about how you approach people, as otherwise, they lose all respect for you and your work. The last
				thing I want to do is appear rude or obnoxious. The attitude towards this task was that we had to obtain information regardless
				of what the receiver or our onslaught felt; whether they were open to it or not. This does not align with my ethos or ethic as a
				person, let alone a designer, and I suppose this reflection has helped me to understand this. </p>
    <h2 class="subheadings"> Reflection on Illustration, 24/12/17 </h1>
   	<p class ="paragraphs1"> I was told not to illustrate. Avoid Illustrating things. </p>
   	<p class ="paragraphs1"> This hurt my feelings, because I enjoy illustrating. It helps me think. 
		When I'm struggling for ideas it helps me put them down on paper and visualise them. 
		Perhaps this "not illustrating" should have been pitched as "don't use illustration as a final outcome" 
		and instead illustration should be used as my in-betweens, and if something good comes from it, great, 
		but don't stop there.   </p>
   	<p class ="paragraphs1"> Having this conflict though, forced me to question things, and although I didn't have an opinion on this particular topic before someone expressed their own opinion I learned that mine conflicted with theirs. I learned that I disagreed with them, and in that, over the past week or so since it was said, I have formed my own opinion and come to a realisation of how, in this case illustration, works for me. </p>

   <h2 class="subheadings"> Starting Points 14/12/17 </h1>
   	<p class ="paragraphs1"> I suppose the biggest problem is where to start with this. Many suggestions have been made for going on walks, and I agree, a great deal can be observed, collected and thought about on walks. Going to places that one has not been before often sheds light on things in the back of one's mind, or forces a different angle of thinking. Going on an 'aimless' walk, where direction, distance and end goal are not the primary concern allows decision making to be in-the-moment. An immediate engagement and response to and with one's surroundings. </p>

   	<p class="paragraphs1"> Personally, I often prefer ambling in a round-about direction of where I need to go. I once walked from King's Cross Station to the Victoria Miro Gallery (For Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrors). I decided for whatever reason not to use Public Transport, and simply knew that I was on the correct road and kept walking. I found a number of treasures that I would not have had access to on other occasions, and on the whole was very grateful for the exposure. Not to mention the sense of clarity I experienced when arriving at the gallery, and having my eyes attuned for observation by this point.</p>

   	<p class="paragraphs1"> I would like to embark on a new project, that involves tracing my Family History. I've been exceedingly lucky in having inherited the Family Bible that dates back to 1868. This will be a fabulous research project, and I'm thinking that as a sideline I could potentially look for something to collect. It's just about keeping the thought in the back of my mind. </p>


   <h2 class="subheadings"> Rarity and Value 13/12/17 </h1>
   	<p class = paragraphs1>  I've been thinking about chance, rarity, value and how these things interplay and play a vital role in creating novelty. There are games that place particular emphasis on certain things in order to make them valuable, perhaps what is most fascinating is the fact that these entities are only valued in these artificial environments. Like the Yellow Car Game for example, in which yellow cars are valuable as spotting one allows you to punch the other players. In tutorial we talked about collections of these by-chance things; for example a collection of books that were released and then recalled due to errors, coins collected purely for their sounds, or abandoned items of clothing in parks<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mattward/albums/1428963"> (Lost Winter Garments).</a>  </p>
   	<p class = "paragraphs1"> The challenge has been set for me to create my own collection of rarities, the only problem is I do not know what this is or how to set about finding it. I suppose the only way to discover this is to go out and start taking photos...</p>

   													width: 400px ; 
   													transform: rotate(90deg); 
   													padding-right: 30px;"> 
   	<p class = "paragraphs1"> For example this miscellaneous shopping trolley left on the pavement. I wonder how many other shopping trolleys have strayed far from their original homes. I suppose that by collecting enough images and making an archive, eventually this topic could become interesting.</p>



   	<h2 class="subheadings"> Reflection w/b 27/11/17 </h1>
	<p class = "paragraphs1"> This week we've been looking at the Matsutake Mushroom. At the beginning of the week I didn't feel like I knew anything about the Mushroom; I thought it was some kind of Magic Mushroom or Hallucinogen, which I have since learned is not true. The most interesting of the Mushroom's qualities for me was its rarity, and that is what the 'making' part of the project will be built upon. The struggle is finding something rare to document or treasure in such a way that it becomes valuable.   </p>
