   <h2 class="subheadings"> Rarity and Value 13/12/17 </h1>
   	<p class = paragraphs1>  I've been thinking about chance, rarity, value and how these things interplay and play a vital role in creating novelty. There are games that place particular emphasis on certain things in order to make them valuable, perhaps what is most fascinating is the fact that these entities are only valued in these artificial environments. Like the Yellow Car Game for example, in which yellow cars are valuable as spotting one allows you to punch the other players. In tutorial we talked about collections of these by-chance things; for example a collection of books that were released and then recalled due to errors, coins collected purely for their sounds, or abandoned items of clothing in parks<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mattward/albums/1428963"> (Lost Winter Garments).</a>  </p>
   	<p class = "paragraphs1"> The challenge has been set for me to create my own collection of rarities, the only problem is I do not know what this is or how to set about finding it. I suppose the only way to discover this is to go out and start taking photos...</p>
   	<img src= "miscshoppingtrolley.JPG" style = " 	 position: center;
   													padding-top : 60px;
   													padding-bottom: 30px;
   													width: 400px ; 
   													transform: rotate(90deg); 
   													padding-right: 30px;"> 
   	<p class = "paragraphs1"> For example this miscellaneous shopping trolley left on the pavement. I wonder how many other shopping trolleys have strayed far from their original homes. I suppose that by collecting enough images and making an archive, eventually this topic could become interesting.</p>

   	<h2 class="subheadings"> Reflection w/b 27/11/17 </h1>
	<p class = "paragraphs1"> This week we've been looking at the Matsutake Mushroom. At the beginning of the week I didn't feel like I knew anything about the Mushroom; I thought it was some kind of Magic Mushroom or Hallucinogen, which I have since learned is not true. The most interesting of the Mushroom's qualities for me was its rarity, and that is what the 'making' part of the project will be built upon. The struggle is finding something rare to document or treasure in such a way that it becomes valuable.   </p>
